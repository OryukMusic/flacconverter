# flacconverter
This program will convert your flacs to wavs or mp3s and in the case of mp3s edit the metadata of your files. 

To use it, just open main.py. It will automatically download all the pip requirements. If you want to convert to MP3, please make sure you have ffmpeg installed (www.ffmpeg.org)
